- Identification. Ask users "Who are you?",å¯¹å¤–å£°æ˜Žèº«ä»½
- Authentication. Check that users really are who they claim to be
- Authorization. Let users perform certain actions based on who they are
- Accountability. Keep records of users' actions for future review


In this guide, we'll go through a series of simple, comprehensible steps to secure a web app, implement IAAA, and user industry-standard mechanisms:

- Step 0. Bootstrap an openly accessible analytical app with Cube.js
- Step 1. Add authentication with signed and encrypted JSON Web Tokens
- Step 2. Add authorization, multi-tenancy, and role-based access control with security claims which are stored in JSON Web Tokens
- Step 3. Add identification via an external provider with Auth0 and use JSON Web Keys to validate JSON Web Tokens
- Step 4. Add accountability with audit logs
- Step 5. Feel great about building a secure app ðŸ˜Ž
